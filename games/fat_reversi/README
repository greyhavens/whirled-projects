This is a simple game of Reversi built using the Flash Authoring Tool. Use the
fatserver.bat script in the top-level whirled SDK directory to run the
resulting Reversi.swf file in the game test environment.

Take a look at the "reversi" example for a version of Reversi written entirely
in ActionScript and built and tested from the command line.
