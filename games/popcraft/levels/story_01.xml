"The famed Weardd Academy
  known the world 'round
Caught fire last night
  and burned to the ground.
Foul play is suspected.
A youth's rage misdirected?
Now Headmaster Weardd
  is nowhere to be found."
        introText2="A massive fire has reduced the Academy to rubble. Ralph, that bastard, is taking advantage of the chaos to mount a small campaign against you. Turn your Flesh and Energy into Street-Walkers to tear down his workshop!"
