* Terrain - hit testing doesn't work if the sprite isn't on screen, so the 
  current method doesn't work unless we force you to be zoomed out enough to 
  see everything whenever something is rolling. Bleh.
* Pan to coordinate, don't snap
* Pan and track ball movement
* Fix drag behavior when mouse leaves window; look at chat's scrollbar to see
  how it does it - appears it has to do with hooking into the systemManager to
  listen for events as well. See also: mx.controls.Button
* Reuse one mallet rather than recreating them over and over
* Figure out why watching doesn't work (they see the WonderlandStatus just peachy, but don't
  see the balls. Likely I'm not actually publishing most of that stuff in a reasonable manner)
