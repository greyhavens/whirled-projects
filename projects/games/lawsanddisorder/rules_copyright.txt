ABOUT
===============================================

Laws and Disorder is played with 2-6 players and a deck of custom cards including: 
    Job cards such as Judge, Banker, Priest
    Verb cards such as gains, loses, gives
    Object cards such as 1 card, 2 monies, 3 monies
The objective is to earn monies by creating sentences (laws) using these cards, such as:
    The Judge loses 2 monies
Every player is dealt a job.  When the above law is made, the player who is currently
the judge will lose 2 of their monies.  Players can change jobs during their turn
by using the appropriate job card.  Every job also has an ability that can be used once per
turn, for example:
    The Priest can exchange a Job card from their hand with one already in a law
    The Thief can look at another player's hand and steal a card from it
The game gets more dynamic with the addition of When cards to laws, which cause laws to 
trigger repeatedly when certain conditions are met, such as:
    When a law is created
Players draw two cards at the start of their turn and can make one law, change jobs once, and
use one ability during their turn.  When the deck of cards runs out, the game is over and
the players are ranked according to how many monies they have.

===============================================
RULES
===============================================

The following rules and cardlist have been simplified for the flash version of this game.

===============================================
CARDLIST
===============================================

jobs x 5 per position
1 card x 4
2 card x 4
1 monies x 2
2 monies x 2
3 monies x 2
4 monies x 2
5 monies x 2
gains x 8
loses x 6
gives x 6

any position x 4
at the start of their turn x 2
when a law is made x 2
when they use their ability x 2

===============================================
SETTING UP
===============================================

Players start with 7 cards and 3 monies
All 6 positions are randomly delt out

===============================================
GAMEPLAY
===============================================

[start of turn]

in any order you may:
- make one law
- play one BLUE card from your hand to change positions
- use one ability

[ end of turn]

- draw two cards

[play passes to next player; players may only do things during their turn]

===============================================
MAKING A LAW
===============================================

- when you create a law, you get $1 for every card in the law

examples:

THE JUDGE   GIVES   1 CARD
  when this law is made, the current JUDGE selects one card from their had and passes it
  hidden to a player of their choice
  
THE THEIF   LOOSES   1 CARD    WHEN THEY USE THEIR ABILITY
  Nothing happens when the law is made.  As long as it is on the board, if someone playing 
  THE THIEF steals a card from someone, they must chose and discard a card immediately after.
  
THE SCIENTIST   GIVES    THE BANKER   3 MONIES    WHEN A LAW IS MADE
  Nothting happens when the law is made.  As long as it is on the board, if anyone makes a law,
  the player playing as THE SCIENTIST at the time must give THE BANKER 3 monies.  If nobody is
  playing at THE SCIENTIST, nothing happens.  If nobody is playing as THE BANKER, the scientist
  simply loses the monies.

THE SCIENTIST GETS 3 MONIES
  If a scientist uses their ability to add WHEN THEY USE THEIR ABILITY to the end of this law,
  they will get the 3 monies because the old law is checked after it has been changed.

===============================================
TRIGGERING LAWS
===============================================

- If there is no PURPLE card in a new law, it triggers right away
- If there is a PURPLE card in a law, it does not trigger when created
- Ammending laws does not trigger them
- When a card is played, an ability is used or a law is made, any laws on the table that 
    are going to trigger do so in order of their original creation, and only after the ability 
    or new law takes effect.

THE THEIF   LOOSES   1 CARD    WHEN THEY USE THEIR ABILITY
If thief steals while this is in play, first they take a card, then have to discard one.

THE SCIENTIST   GIVES    THE BANKER   3 MONIES    WHEN A LAW IS MADE
If a new law THE BANKER GIVES THE THIEF 1 MONIES is created while this is in play, first
the player who created the law gets X monies where X is the length of the new law.  Then
the new law triggers and the banker must give the thief 1 monie.  Finally the old law triggers
and the banker must give the scientist 3 monies.

===============================================
GAME END
===============================================

- When the last card is drawn, each player gets one more full turn, then the game ends.
- The player with the most monies wins.

===============================================

===============================================
POINTS AND CARDS [YELLOW]
===============================================

Can be used as part of a law, eg:
SCIENTIST   GAINS   1 MONIE

===============================================
GIVES/LOSES/GAINS [PINK]
===============================================

Can be used as part of a law.
If a GIVES does not specify to which player, they may choose a player, eg:
BANKER   GIVES   1 CARD
When a player loses cards or gives cards, they get to choose the card.
If "giving" to a player not on the board, the giving player just loses the item.

===============================================
WHENEVER [PURPLE]
===============================================

Can be used as part of a law.

If a law has no PURPLE card, it is assumed to take effect WHEN THIS LAW IS CREATED
