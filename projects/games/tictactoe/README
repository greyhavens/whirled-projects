Tic tac toe is a very simple example of a game that employs a server agent. 

The class Server in src/Server.as is compiled into TicTacToe.abc. This class is then loaded and 
instantiated on the server.

The Server class demonstrated the following features that may be used in your server agent:
* Loading and saving cookies for specific players
* Handling MOVE messages to check for illegal moves (e.g. by hacked clients)
* Awarding trophies and prizes to specific players

The tic tac toe clients in src/TicTacToe.as do not set any properties directly but request all 
moves by sending a Server.MOVE message containing the details of the move.
