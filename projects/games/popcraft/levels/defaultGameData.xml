A combination of volatile gases inside the Delivery Boy’s belly gives this poor fellow explosive indigestion. Take care not to shake your Delivery Boy, or allow him to approach other reanimated creatures; his innards may combust without warning, resulting in spectacular explosions that will render the Delivery Boy, and anything in his immediate vicinity, quite unable to perform any function at all."
