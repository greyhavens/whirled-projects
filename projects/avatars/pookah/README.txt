== Creating Pookah Avatar ==

=== Non-Flipping Body ===

Pookahs use a tweaked body.as file that never flips the avatar when it 
changes direction.  Put this in whirled\examples\avatars\uravatar\src with 
the regular body.as file and you can use it for any avatar you want.  Just 
change the main script references from Body to NoFlipBody, just like the 
pookah has.

=== Style ===

Pookahs are extremely basic avatars.  
My general rule is that they should be simple, involve at least one
repeating pattern (often stripes), and that all lines should be 4px thick.
